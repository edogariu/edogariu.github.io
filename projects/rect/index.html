Below is the course description and some resources about the topic.</p> <p>“This is a monographic course on the topic of rectifiability, a concept introduced first by Besicovitch in the particular case of 1-dimensional sets in the plane. After introducing the Hausdorff dimension, the Hausdorff measures, the course covers Besicovitch’s theory and touches upon the famous Besicovitch 1/2 conjecture, which is almost a century old and still unsolved. It then defines rectifiable sets and rectifiable measures in general dimension and codimension and covers the most basic and widely used rectifiability criteria..”</p> <p>Everything we learned was very elegant and beautiful despite its technicality. Since the course was not meant for undergrads we moved extremely fast and so I was exposed to a lot of new concepts very quickly. We focused a lot on proving the Besicovitch-Marstrand-Preiss Theorem and some criteria for rectifiability and pure unrectifiability, developing analyses using rectifiable and tangent measures.</p> <h1 id="reading-list">Reading List</h1> <ul> <li>Frank Morgan’s “Geometric Measure Theory: A Beginner’s Guide” (in the direction of currents and varifolds).</li> <li>Pertti Matilla’s “Geometry of Sets and Measures in Euclidean Spaces: Fractals and Rectifiability” (in the direction of rectifiablity and tangent structure).</li> <li>Prof. De Lellis’ <a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~toro/Courses/07-08/582/delellis-06.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">lecture notes</a> on rectifiability and density.</li> <li>Leon Simon’s <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/math285/ts-gmt.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">textbook</a> (builds toward varifolds and integration).</li> <li>Evans &amp; Gareipy <a href="https://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/file.php/MATH724/Evans%20L.C.%2C%20Gariepy%20R.F.%20-%20Measure%20theory%20and%20fine%20properties%20of%20functions-CRC%20%281992%29%20%282%29.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Measure Theory and Fine Properties of Functions</a>.</li> </ul> <h1 id="notes--problem-sets">Notes &amp; Problem Sets</h1> <ul> <li>My <a href="/assets/pdf/rect/notes.pdf">notes</a> from lecture</li> <li>My problem sets!
