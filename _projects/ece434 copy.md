# Description
This is the page for <a href="https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1234&courseid=012614">a course at Princeton</a> taught by the fantastic Prof. Michael Aizenman that I took during Spring 2023. Below is the course description and some resources about the topic.

"An introduction to the statistical mechanic of classical and quantum spin systems. Among the topics to be discussed are phase transitions, emergent structures, critical phenomena, and scaling limits. The goal is to present the physics embodied in the subject along with mathematical methods, from probability and analysis, for rigorous results concerning the phenomena displayed by, and within, the subject's essential models."
