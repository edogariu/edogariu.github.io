# Description
This is the page for <a href=https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1234&courseid=008172">a course at Princeton</a> (third in Stein analysis sequence) taught by the incredible Prof. Paul Minter I took during Spring 2023. Below is the course description and some resources about the topic.

"The theory of Lebesgue integration in n-dimensional space. Differentiation theory. Hilbert space theory and applications to Fourier Transforms, and partial differential equations. Introduction to fractals. This course is the third semester of a four-semester sequence, but may be taken independently of the other semesters."

This was a beautiful course and Prof. Minter was a fantastic instructor. We basically followed the third Stein book but the lectures and problem sets kept us seeing the bigger bicture the whole time. 

# Reading List
- Stein & Shakarchi <a href="http://www.cmat.edu.uy/~mordecki/courses/medida2013/book.pdf">Book III: Measure Theory, Integration, and Hilbert Spaces </a> (round these parts we call it "Stein 3")
- thats basically it. anything covering the fundamentals likely overlaps significantly.

- My problem sets! I don't think any are really awfully wrong, but some are incorrect for sure. Email me if there's anything to discuss:
