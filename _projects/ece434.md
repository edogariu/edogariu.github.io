# Description
This is the page for <a href="https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1242&courseid=002096">a course at Princeton</a> taught by the fantastic Prof. Chi Jin that I took during Fall 2023. Below is the course description and some resources about the topic.

"The course covers fundamental results in statistical learning theory: 1. Supervised learning: generalization, uniform concentration, empirical risk minimizer, Rademacher complexity, VC theory, reproducing Hilbert kernel space and several applications including neural networks, sparse linear regression, and low-rank matrix problems; 2. Online learning: sequential Rademacher complexity, littlestone dimension, online algorithms and applications; 3. Unsupervised learning: latent variable models, maximum likelihood estimation, method of moments, tensor methods."
