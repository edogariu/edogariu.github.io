# Description
This is the page for <a href="https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1244&courseid=012999">a course at Princeton</a> taught by the lovely Prof. Jacob Shapiro that I took during Spring 2024. Below is the course description and some resources about the topic.

"The course discusses rigorous results in quantum mechanics, relevant for condensed matter physics. Topics to be covered include: Effect of disorder on quantum dynamics, quantum transport and linear response theory, topological phases of matter, quantum Hall effect and topological classification of insulators (via K-theory or otherwise)."

This class was the reason that <a href="/_projects/functional.md">the previous semester's functional analysis course</a> went toward spectral theory and all. Really beautiful stuff.
