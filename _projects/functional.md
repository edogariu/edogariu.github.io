# Description
This is the page for <a href="https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1242&courseid=012150">a course at Princeton</a> taught by the lovely Prof. Jacob Shapiro that I took during Fall 2023. Below is the course description and some resources about the topic.

"Basic introductory course to modern methods of analysis. The possible topics may include $L^p$ spaces, Banach spaces, uniform boundedness principle, closed graph theorem, locally convex spaces, distributions, Fourier transform, Riesz interpolation theorem, Hardy-Littlewood maximal function, Calderon-Zygmund theory, oscillatory integrals, almost orthogonality, Sobolev spaces, restriction theorems, spectral theory of compact operators, applications to partial differential equations."
