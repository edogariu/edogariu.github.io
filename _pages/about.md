Hi! My name is **Evan Dogariu**, and I am a first-year Ph.D. student in computer science at NYU Courant, where I am very excited to be advised by [Prof. Joan Bruna](https://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/). Previously, I majored in computer science at Princeton (with physics minor), where I was very very lucky to be advised by [Prof. Elad Hazan](https://www.ehazan.com) :)

I love research and the feeling of being stuck on problems (up to a certain point). Feel free to contact me at `ed2719@<nyu>.edu` (without the brackets) for anything and everything, including just being friendly.

My (probably not updated) CV is attached <a href="assets/pdf/Evan_CV.pdf">here</a>.
