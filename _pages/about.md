Hi! My name is **Evan Dogariu**, and I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at NYU Courant. Previously, I majored in Computer Science at Princeton, where I was very very lucky to be advised by Prof. Elad Hazan :). I love research and the art of skillful and exciting learning. Feel free to contact me at `ed2719@<nyu>.edu` (without the brackets) for anything and everything, including just being friendly.

My CV is attached <a href="assets/pdf/Evan_CV.pdf">here</a>.
