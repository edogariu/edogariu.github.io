Hi! My name is **Evan Dogariu**, and I am currently an undergraduate at Princeton majoring in Computer Science, with planned certificates in Applied Math and Engineering Physics. I am thankful to be advised by Prof. Elad Hazan :). I am currently applying for Ph. D. programs with emphasis on deep learning theory and optimization. I love research and the art of skillful and exciting learning. Feel free to contact me at `edogariu@<princeton>.edu` (without the brackets) for anything and everything, including just being friendly.
